Problem statement
=================
In the dynamic landscape of research, staying abreast of the latest developments and insights within one's field is
paramount for researchers aiming to contribute meaningfully to their respective domains.
However, the sheer volume of research publications across diverse databases poses a significant challenge, making it
increasingly difficult for researchers to navigate and extract pertinent information efficiently.
In response to this challenge, the SysReview emerges as a pioneering solution, offering a comprehensive and
streamlined approach to conducting Systematic Reviews across various research domains.

A Systematic Review serves as a cornerstone of evidence-based research, providing a rigorous and structured methodology
for synthesizing existing literature on a particular topic or research question.
Traditionally, conducting a systematic review involves a series of laborious and time-intensive tasks, including formulating
research questions, designing search queries, retrieving and screening relevant articles, and synthesizing findings.
These tasks often entail manual efforts, leading to inefficiencies, biases, and the potential for oversight.

Solution
========
Recognizing the need for a more efficient and user-friendly approach to systematic reviews, SysReview introduces a novel
dashboard equipped with advanced functionalities to streamline every step of the review process.

SysReview serves as the backbone of this Systematic Review process, offering a suite of tools to facilitate query design,
data extraction, deduplication, and curation tracking.
Researchers can leverage SysReview to formulate precise and comprehensive search queries, seamlessly retrieve research
articles from multiple databases, and streamline the curation process to identify relevant studies effectively.
By automating these essential tasks, SysReview empowers researchers to focus their efforts on analyzing and synthesizing
the retrieved information, rather than navigating the complexities of data retrieval and management.

ARGUS Integration
=================
Complementing SysReview with ARGUS, an innovative tool designed to enhance the reading and scanning experience for
researchers as they engage with relevant research articles. ARGUS leverages advanced algorithms and natural language
processing techniques to assist researchers in comprehensively understanding and extracting key insights from research
articles. By providing researchers with the tools and support necessary to navigate through dense and technical literature
efficiently, ARGUS accelerates the review process while ensuring the thoroughness and accuracy of the synthesized findings.


Summary
=======
The overarching goal of this project is to revolutionize the way researchers conduct systematic reviews, democratizing
access to comprehensive and up-to-date research insights across diverse domains. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies
and methodologies, SysReview empowers researchers, from seasoned academics to budding scholars, to conduct genuine and
impactful research with precision, efficiency, and confidence. Through its user-centric design and robust feature set,
SysReview aims to catalyze innovation and advance knowledge dissemination in the ever-evolving landscape of
research and academia.
